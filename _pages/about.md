<img src="//frippz-se.s3.amazonaws.com/my-face.jpeg" alt="" height="216" width="322" class="left"> Hi! My name is Fredrik Frodlund and that is me when I still had a beard. I'm working as a frontend designer in frosty Sweden (though our summers are really awesome when it’s not raining).

If you're reading this, it very likely means you've found your way to my personal journal. This is a place for me to collect my thoughts, mostly about front end web development. In the good spirit of sharing knowledge, I thought it’d be nice to post all my stuff online for the rest of the world to enjoy. Chances are you might find something useful some day.

Please note that any views and opinions expressed by me on this site are personal and not necessarily shared by my employer.

### Technical stuff

This site is just plain static HTML generated with the help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Vector icons used on this site are provided by [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io). Technology-wise, this site uses good old plain HTML5, CSS3 and, for the moment, fairly small amounts of unobtrusive JavaScript.

#### Platform

I’ve gone from hosting on a regular old-school web host, to Github Pages, to finally landing with my own virtual server. After tinkering with the free tier on Amazon for a while, I decided to pony up the bucks and choose something more permanent. In the end I went with [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/2e95857e7f62) due to their easy to understand pricing model, a nice control panel and a great community with loads of documentation and helpful people. Paying $5 a month for their lowest tier is pretty damn affordable as well. If you want to give them a try, the prior link is a referral that’ll give you a $10 credit. If you happen to like them as much as I do and stay with them, when you spend $25 with them, I get a $25 credit myself.

#### Encryption

I'm also using encryption via SSL provided by [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), a new certificate authority that is free, automated and open. If you’re looking to serve your content encrypted, but always balked at the difficulty and complexity issuing a certificate means, give them a go. They’re currently in open beta.

### Getting in touch

Feeling the need to get in touch with me? Have a business inquiry? Don’t hesitate to shoot me an email at [contact@frippz.se](mailto:contact@frippz.se). I have limited availability for smaller front end related projects from time to time.

#### Please don’t bother contacting me if

* You are a faceless mass-recruiter. I will not reply to you and I will blacklist your email.
* You want to write a guest post or “collaborate”, whatever that actually means.

### Hey, what’s a ”frippz”?

That’s just a nickname my cousin gave me when I was a kid. The ”z” is just because it looks cool. Back in 2005, I quickly needed a domain name for my portfolio when I attended Hyper Island in Karlskrona, and said name came to mind.
