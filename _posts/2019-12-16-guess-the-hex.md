Someone on Twitter saw fit to drive himself and others insane with [a game that lets you guess the correct hex color code](http://hex-guess.glitch.me).

This is as strong a case as any for switching to HSL. Jesus…

Also, check out [this talk by David DeSandro about how to actually read color hex codes](https://www.dotconferences.com/2018/11/david-desandro-read-color-hex-codes). It’s cool as hell, but seriously, [just use HSL instead](https://css-tricks.com/hsl-hsla-is-great-for-programmatic-color-control/).
