Well, now. This is embarassing. It seems that one of my work-in-progress articles was accidentally posted yesterday. Realising my mistake pretty late the next morning, the article was out for almost an entire day. Oh well, it just goes to show that my workflow need more work and maybe less flow.

Said article *will* be posted later on. I just need to finish it. In the meantime, sorry for mucking stuff up and causing confusion.
