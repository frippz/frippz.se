This morning, my app of choice for reading RSS feeds; NetNewsWire, notified me of an update. This was a major version update which included a new app icon and an updated UI for Big Sur. This gave me the opportunity to grab a screenshot to compare. So I did.

{% include image.html
  url="/images/nnw-before-320w.png"
  srcset="/images/nnw-before-640w.png 640w,
          /images/nnw-before-1184w.png 1184w,
          /images/nnw-before-1330w.png 1330w"
  caption="NetNewsWire 5.1.3"
  link="/images/nnw-before.png"
%}

{% include image.html
  url="/images/nnw-after-320w.png"
  srcset="/images/nnw-after-640w.png 640w,
          /images/nnw-after-1184w.png 1184w,
          /images/nnw-after-1330w.png 1330w"
  caption="NetNewsWire 6.0"
  link="/images/nnw-after.png"
%}

It’s a bit pointless, but also interesting to compare how Big Sur affects the design of apps on the Mac. I’m also thankful I get to keep the text below the icons in the toolbar.
