So true. Applying progressive enhancement in all your work makes your job a lot easier in the end. The challenge is selling the idea to your client. In my experience, transparency is key. Be open with how you communicate your ideas and what benefits it will offer. Telling them that a majority of their users will receive the high-end experience, but at the same time a wider audience can be reached, helps a lot.
