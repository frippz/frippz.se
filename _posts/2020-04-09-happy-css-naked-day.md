Today is April 9, which means that it’s [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io)! Never heard of it? It basically means that if you have a website, you should strip it of its CSS.

Why on earth would you do that?

Well, if you know your stuff, you should author your markup before doing any styling. This is unfortunately something that most developers almost _never_ do, which is a sad thing. The information architecture of a website should be good enough that no styling should be required to be able to use the site. That’s the whole point of CSS Naked Day.

So, how did my site fare?
