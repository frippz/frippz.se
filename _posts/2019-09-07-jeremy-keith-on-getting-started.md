I’ve gotten the question myself on more than one occasion; how should I get into front end development? Besides my recommendation of starting out with HTML, then moving on to CSS and lastly get into JavaScript, I often had to dig deep to find good sources for people to read that would help and inspire them. Thanks to Jeremy, that job has been done for me. From now on, I’ll link to his post.

I would like to add that Jeremy’s own excellent book "Resilient Web Design" should be part of the curriculum. Best of all is that it’s [available for free online](https://resilientwebdesign.com).

Thanks, Keith!
