This sample show some CSS code highlighted using [prism.js](http://prismjs.com).

~~~css
html {
  padding: 2em 4em;
}
~~~

Looks really nice, no? Also, letÂ´s try some HTML!

~~~markup
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

So how about some bash, yeah?

~~~bash
cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1
~~~

There we go!

Ok, how about some blockquotes?

> This was quoted by some dude. Who knows who he was?

Alright!
