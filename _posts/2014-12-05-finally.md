It took me long enough, but after getting some time to finish learning the inner workings of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (which has been the tool of choice for this project), I welcome you to my personal journal!

I have to be honest. This entire project is actually created for one person, and one person alone; *me*. I'm using this web site as a place to collect my thoughts and experiments related to front end web development. But since it is a nice thing to share, I'll of course make it all public. Should you ever find anything I write here of use, so much the better.
