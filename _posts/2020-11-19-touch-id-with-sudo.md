When the first MacBook Pro with a Touch ID sensor was released, I was thoroughly excited. Rightly so. Apps like 1Password was quick to implement support for it. There was one thing that was missing though; authentication with `sudo`.

I‚Äôm almost ashamed that after having owned at least two MacBook Pros with Touch ID, I didn't find out until today about this. So it‚Äôs time to write it down. Hat tip to [Stanislas and his post ‚ÄúUsing Touch ID for sudo authentication on a MacBook‚Äù](https://stanislas.blog/2019/09/touch-id-sudo-macbook/) for showing me the way.

Edit (as root) `/etc/pam.d/sudo`:

```bash
# sudo: auth account password session
auth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so
auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so		# <= Add this line!
auth       required       pam_opendirectory.so
account    required       pam_permit.so
password   required       pam_deny.so
session    required       pam_permit.so
```

For clarity, the line you want to add (as seen above) is:

```bash
auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so
```

That‚Äôs all you need! Oh, and your finger, of course! üòâ
