# frippz.se

This repo contains the Jekyll source code for my personal journal at frippz.se.

If you wish to create your own Jekyll web site, you shouldnâ€™t clone this repo, but instead head over to [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com) and get a copy from there.

## Usage

Right now the project runs two processes in parallel; Gulp and Jekyll. Two terminal sessions is required, one to run `gulp` and one to run `jekyll s --drafts`.

Node packages are now included in the repo to remove external dependencies.
