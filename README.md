# frippz.se

This repo contains the Jekyll source code for my personal journal at frippz.se.

If you wish to create your own Jekyll web site, you shouldn’t clone this repo, but instead head over to [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com) and get a copy from there.

## Usage

This project uses Gulp to build static resources (JS & CSS) as well as building the Jekyll files, as well as serve them using [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server). You basically need to do two things:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

That’s it!
