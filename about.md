My name is Fredrik Frodlund and that is me looking sceptical on the green fields of Northern Ireland, not far from Giant’s Causeway. I'm working as a front end web developer working for [Jayway](http://www.jayway.com/), a consultancy in Malmö, Sweden.

If you're reading this, it very likely means you've found your way to my personal journal. This is a place for me to collect my thoughts, mostly about front end web development. In the good spirit of sharing knowledge, I thought it be nice to post all my stuff online for the rest world to enjoy. Chances are you might find something useful some day.

Please note that any views and opinions expressed by me on this site are personal and not necessarily shared by my employer.

### Technical stuff

This site is just plain static HTML generated with the help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Font icons used on this site are provided by [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io). Technology-wise, this site uses good old plain HTML5, CSS3 and, for the moment, fairly small amounts of progressively enhanced JavaScript.

### Getting in touch

Feeling the need to get in touch with me? Don’t hesitate to shoot me an email at [contact@frippz.se](mailto:contact@frippz.se). The exception, of course, is if you happen to be a recruiter. Then you should just send an email to [spam@frippz.se](mailto:spam@frippz.se). Your service provider’s mail server will by all accounts bounce that email and that should be enough of a clue for you…
