  class="left"> Hello! I’m Fredrik and that right there is me. I'm working as a front end developer in frosty Sweden (though our summers are really awesome when it’s not raining).

If you're reading this, it very likely means you've found your way to my personal journal. This is a place for me to collect my thoughts, mostly about front end web development. In the good spirit of sharing knowledge, I thought it’d be nice to post all my stuff online for the rest of the world to enjoy. Chances are you might find something useful some day.

Please note that any views and opinions expressed by me on this site are personal and not necessarily shared by my employer.

### Technical stuff

This site is just plain static HTML generated with the help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Vector icons used on this site are provided by [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io). Technology-wise, this site uses good old plain HTML5, CSS3 and, for the moment, fairly small amounts of unobtrusive vanilla JavaScript.

#### Platform

I’ve moved from Github Pages to running my own virtual host at Digital Ocean, to currently hosting on AWS using S3 and CloudFront, mostly just to learn how AWS works. It certainly is overkill for my simple needs, but it's always fun to learn new stuff, right? I also use Github Actions for continous deployment and testing.

### Getting in touch

Need to get in touch with me? I’m reachable at [contact@frippz.se](mailto:contact@frippz.se).

#### Please don’t bother contacting me if

* You’re a recruiter. I will not reply. I’m just fine where I work today and if that changes then I’ll find something else on my own.
* You want to offer your services to me, like building a web page. This is what I do for a living, so please stop wasting both your time and mine.
* You want to write a guest post or “collaborate”, whatever that means.

### frippz?

That’s just a nickname my cousin gave me when I was a kid. The ”z” is just because it looks cool. Back in 2005, I quickly needed a domain name for my portfolio when I attended [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com) in Karlskrona, and said name came to mind.
