  <h1>Highlighted text</h1>
  <p>A <mark class="theme-pink">marker pen</mark>, fineliner, marking pen, felt-tip marker, felt-tip pen, flow, marker or texta (in Australia) or sketch pen (in India), is a pen <mark class="theme-blue">which has its own ink-source</mark>, and a tip made of porous, pressed fibers such as felt. A permanent marker consists of a container (glass, aluminum or plastic) and a core of an absorbent material. This filling serves as a carrier for the ink. The upper part of the <mark class="theme-yellow">marker contains the nib that was made in earlier time of a hard felt material</mark>, and a cap to prevent the marker from drying out. Until the early 1990s the most common solvents that were used for the ink were toluene and xylene. These two substances are <mark class="theme-green">both harmful and characterized</mark> by a very strong smell. Today, the ink is usually made on the basis of alcohols (e.g. 1-propanol, 1-butanol, diacetone alcohol and cresols). Markers may be waterproof, dry-erase, or permanent which will be further expanded on in this article.</p>
