While I certainly don’t subscribe to the notion that shaming is a good thing, I… Who am I kidding? Shaming is the best! Especially when you’re part of the mob, am I right?

Seriously, though. Sometimes you come across stuff on the web that really grinds your gears. I found one such thing yesterday when I surfed around on a Swedish news site that in turn linked to an article on another Swedish news site; Dagens Industri. After scrolling for a second, something hit me.

[![Dagens Industri with a huge ad banner taking up almost 33% of the viewport](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/817490/frippz.se/dagens-industri.jpg)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/817490/frippz.se/dagens-industri.jpg)

As you can clearly see, that’s almost a third of the viewport taken up by that hideous banner.
